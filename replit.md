# RCC Security Management System

## Overview

The RCC Security Management System is a comprehensive Next.js application designed for tracking and managing personnel, visitors, and contractors in a security-controlled environment. The system provides real-time monitoring capabilities, entry/exit tracking, and integrates with an Odoo ERP backend for staff management. Built with modern web technologies, it features a professional dashboard interface for security operations.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application is built with Next.js 14 using the App Router pattern and implements a component-based architecture:

- **Main Dashboard** (`app/page.tsx`) - Central hub with category tracking and real-time statistics
- **Admin Dashboard** (`app/admin/page.tsx`) - Administrative interface for staff and project management
- **Component Library** - Modular components using shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives
- **Form System** - Specialized entry forms for different visitor categories (staff, clients, contractors, suppliers, visitors)
- **Data Tables** - Interactive tables for viewing and managing entry records with search and filtering

**Design System**: Uses Tailwind CSS with a dark professional theme, featuring custom CSS variables for consistent theming across components.

### Backend Integration Architecture
The system employs a hybrid approach for data management:

- **Client-side Storage** - localStorage for immediate data persistence and offline capability
- **Odoo ERP Integration** - Custom REST API module for HR employee management
- **XML-RPC Protocol** - Communication layer with Odoo backend for staff verification
- **API Routes** - Next.js API routes for data processing and external service communication

**Authentication Flow**: 
- **Staff Authentication**: Predefined credentials (File ID/Password) with secure server-side session management
- **Admin Authentication**: Environment-protected password with HTTP-only cookie sessions
- **Role-based Access Control**: Server-side enforcement ensuring staff see only assigned project data
- **Odoo Integration**: Employee lookup through Odoo's HR module for additional staff verification

### Data Storage Solutions
**Primary Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of all entries and assignments
**Projects Storage**: JSON file (`data/all_real_projects.json`) containing all 245 real-world projects
**Session Management**: HTTP-only cookies with secure server-side session validation
**External Database**: Odoo ERP system for employee master data
**Image Handling**: Base64 encoding for profile photos and captured images
**Backup Storage**: Browser localStorage for offline capability and legacy support

The system uses a schema-based approach with TypeScript interfaces for type safety across all data operations.

**Supabase Integration** (Updated: October 2, 2025):
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase for persistent data storage
- **Tables**: 
  - `entries` - Stores all visitor/staff/contractor entry records with timestamps
  - `assignments` - Stores staff-to-project assignments
- **Authentication**: Secure API key-based authentication with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- **Real-time sync**: All entry and assignment data persists across server restarts

**Projects Management** (Updated: October 2, 2025):
- **Storage**: 245 projects stored in `/data/all_real_projects.json`
- **API**: Projects API reads from JSON file for fast access
- **Structure**: Each project includes id, name, description, status, priority, start date, and assignment info
- **Updates**: Project assignments saved back to JSON file when admins assign projects to staff

### Form Validation and User Input
**Validation Library**: Zod for TypeScript-first schema validation
**Form Management**: React Hook Form for performant form handling
**Input Components**: Custom form components for each visitor category with category-specific validation rules

### Real-time Features
**Time Tracking**: Live duration calculation for active entries
**Status Management**: Real-time entry/exit status updates
**Overtime Detection**: Automatic flagging of entries exceeding 8-hour duration
